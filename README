Description
===========
- jsminisite is supposed to be a minimalistic framework for creating websites whose content is stored in a single HTML file but that appears to the visitor as if it consists of multiple pages.


Design goals and/or TODOs
=========================
- It should be possible, to create the webpage out of one HTML and one JavaScript file.
- Independence from server sided scripting/programming languages like PHP, Perl etc.
- The script should work with all recent major browsers.
- No use of other JavaScript libraries.
- Users having JavaScript disabled should nevertheless be able to read the complete content of the website.


Installation
============
- See example index.htm.
- The most important part is to have a div with id="content" that contains div's for each page that have their menu titles as IDs.


Credits/Ideas/Contributions
===========================
- Georg JÃ¤hnig
- Eric Meyer for his Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System (S5) that is used in a very similar way.
